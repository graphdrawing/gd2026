## Speaker Information
The presentations will follow the usual format, i.e. there are 20 minute slots for long and 15 minute slots for short papers (including questions, so please prepare for a slightly shorter talk).

There will be a presentation laptop to show PDF and PowerPoint slides. We only support one option for uploading your slides to the presentation laptop:
- You can upload your presentation via an upload-only link that will be announced. In this case, your presentation file name should start with the prefix **SessionX_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME**, where **X** is the number of the session you are presenting in (refer to the [conference program](../program))
- The maximum resolution of the projector located in the symposium room is 1920x1200 (normally 1920x1080 used for 16:9 images).


**Note:** We strongly recommend to have a USB stick with your presentation at hand for emergency purposes.

**Please upload your slides by September 22 at the latest.**

## Information for Poster Presenters
There will be a Fast Forward Teaser session preceding the poster and demo session on Wednesday, September 24.
For each presented poster and exhibited software, there will be the possibility to advertise the poster/software in one minute.

The one-minute teaser can be accompanied by a teaser slide, which has to be a one-page PDF and should be sent to <a href="mailto:gd2025@easychair.org">gd2025@easychair.org</a> no later than September 14.

Posters can be up to A0 (portrait) size. Please bring your posters on Wednesday, September 24 and hang them up in the Trozelli Gallery area by 14:00 at the very latest.
