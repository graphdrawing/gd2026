## SafeToC

GD2025 supports <a href="https://safetoc.org/" target="_blank">SafeToC</a>.

## GD Code of Conduct

An open exchange of ideas and respectful debate are central goals of the International Symposium on Graph Drawing and Network Visualization (GD). All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers attending the conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everyone.

## Need Help?

The main points of contact for this code of conduct are the SafeToC advocates:

## The Quick Version

GD is dedicated to providing an environment that is free from harassment, bullying, discrimination, and retaliation for all participants, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. Bullying, intimidation, personal attacks, harassment, sustained disruption of talks or other events, and behavior that interferes with another's full participation will not be tolerated. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any conference. Participants who violate these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference organisers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Bullying includes physical or intellectual aggression, use of inappropriate language, name calling, threats (explicit or implicit) of intent to harm or to coerce, especially in the context of an imbalance of power or authority.

If a participant engages in harassing or bullying behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund. Note that a response of "just joking" will not be accepted; behavior can be harassing without an intent to offend.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns about the GD environment, please contact one of the advocates listed above or any member of the Steering Committee immediately.

We will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.
