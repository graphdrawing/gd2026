The city of Norrk√∂ping is located approximately 150 kilometers south of Stockholm. Trains are running regularly from Arlanda airport just north of Stockholm. Trains are either running from Arlanda to Stockholm, and then another train from Stockholm to Norrk√∂ping, or direct trains from Arlanda to Norrk√∂ping which is a cheaper alternative. Stockholm Arlanda airport has many connections over the world.

The campus in Norrk√∂ping is conveniently in the middle of the city with walking distance to anything and everything. It is about 15 minutes slow walk from the train station. And about 10 minutes to the conference venue.

**Payments in Sweden**
Sweden is a nearly cashless country. Many places in Sweden like restaurants, cafes, kiosks, pharmacies refuse cash payments and accept cards only. In addition, public transports in most cities do not accept cash payments, either. So you are not likely to need a great deal of hard currency for your stay in Sweden. Instead, it is advisable to have a credit or debit card that can be used to pay expenses outside your country. Please note that in order to pay or withdraw cash with your credit card it requires that you have a card with chip and PIN (Personal Identification Number). The older magnetic-stripe cards won‚Äôt work.
